# SauceLabsPlaywrightAutomation
This Playwright automation framework follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern and keeps everything modular and configurable. The configuration values like URLs and selectors are not hardcoded into the test scripts, making it easy to maintain and scale. The use of reporting helps in identifying the results easily.
